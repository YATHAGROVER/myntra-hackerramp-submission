# Outfit Visualizer and Personalized Outfit Recommendation System

## Overview

This project aims to redefine how users engage with their wardrobe by offering a sophisticated outfit visualization experience and intelligent outfit recommendations based on specific criteria.

Our system goes beyond traditional try-on applications by empowering users to mix and match tops and bottoms of their choice on a virtual model. This allows them to visualize complete outfits effortlessly. Moreover, the system intelligently recommends complementary tops or bottoms based on the user's initial selection, ensuring a personalized and curated shopping experience.

## Key Features

### Virtual Try-On

- Users can select and visualize combinations of tops and bottoms on a virtual model.
- Seamless adjustment and fitting of garments to achieve a realistic representation.
- Ability to see and experience the chosen outfit virtually before making a purchase.

### Personalized Outfit Recommendations

- Intelligent recommendation engine suggests tops based on selected bottoms and vice versa.
- Recommendations are tailored according to specific labels such as occasion (e.g., work, party, casual).
- Users can filter recommendations to suit their preferences and style.

## How It Works

### Virtual Try-On

- Users choose tops and bottoms from their wardrobe or virtual catalog.
