Outfit visualizer and  Recommendation System:
This project aims to revolutionize the way users interact with their wardrobe by providing a seamless virtual try-on experience and personalized outfit recommendations based on specific labels like occasion.

Overview
Our system goes beyond traditional try-on applications by empowering users to mix and match tops and bottoms of their choice on a virtual model. This allows them to visualize complete outfits effortlessly. Moreover, the system intelligently recommends complementary tops or bottoms based on the user's initial selection, ensuring a personalized and curated shopping experience.

Key Features

Virtual Try-On:
Users can select and visualize combinations of tops and bottoms on a virtual model.
Seamless adjustment and fitting of garments to achieve a realistic representation.
Ability to see and experience the chosen outfit virtually before making a purchase.

Personalized Outfit Recommendations:
Intelligent recommendation engine suggests tops based on selected bottoms and vice versa.
Recommendations are tailored according to specific labels such as occasion (e.g., work, party, casual).
Users can filter recommendations to suit their preferences and style.
